# Advent of Code :evergreen_tree:

Here my answers to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge.

# Launch

With your input in a file `inputXX.txt` (where `XX` is the #day).

```bash
./sbt "run aocYYYY.dayXX" < inputXX.txt
```

Where:
 * `YYYY` is the year
 * `XX` is the day

## Examples:

For the first day of december 2018:

```bash
./sbt "run aoc2018.day01" < input01.txt
```

Enjoy! :evergreen_tree:
